# dynamic-widget-site

A content site where each element, including the title and individual content items, is designed as widgets. Incorporate a feature that introduces an 'Add Widget' button, which automatically scrolls from the left of the screen. Clicking this button should enable users to easily add new widgets to the site. This approach should facilitate a highly customizable and dynamic user experience, allowing for the personalized arrangement and display of content. The interface should be user-friendly and adaptable to both desktop and mobile platforms.
